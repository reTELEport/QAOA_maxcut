NOTICE: The pictures may fail to reload in github, so it is better to view the notebook by nbviewer or local host jupyternotebook[https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/reTELEport/QAOA_maxcut/blob/master/code/QAOA_maxcut_Qiskit.ipynb]. 

This tutorial aims to introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm named Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). To have a concret idea of 
QAOA, we apply to the MaxCut problem to show how to realize QAOA by coding with Qiskit.
